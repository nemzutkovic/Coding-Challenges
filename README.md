# Coding Challenges

Contains all of my personal solutions to any coding challenges that I take part in.

## Format

There will be a directory for each platform that has coding challenges. For starters, I am completing the problems on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/nemzutkovic/) and [Kattis](https://open.kattis.com/users/nem-zutkovic).

## Other

I'm definitely more of a beginner now, but if there is any problem you'd like to challenge me with, hit me up! Took me a while to realize, but I really enjoying coding challenges.
