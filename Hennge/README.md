# Hennge Challenge

Coding challenge given by Hennge for their [Global Internship Program](https://hennge.com/global/gip/). There are three parts to the challenge, which is outlined in the PDF.

## Mission 1

I first wrote the solution in C++ because I didn't know the programming language Go. Then, I converted the logic I used in my C++ solution to Go. Lastly, I installed Go on my system, tested it out by piping in a text file to the program, and the solution worked just right. It was an easy question.

## Mission 2

The second mission was to create a secret GIST on GITHUB so they can see your solution. That's pretty straightforward as well.

## Mission 3

This was the final challenge, which I did not finish. It was to create a POST request, with HTTP authentication, in the language of your choice. It was getting too involved with the whole password stuff, so I just concluded that it wasn't worth the effort.
